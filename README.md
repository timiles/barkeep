# Barkeep :musical_note::saxophone:

Barkeep is a nifty little tool I made to assist my saxophone practice.
I had a CD of backing tracks to play along with, but every time I stuffed up a solo
I just wished I could shout out a bar number and have the CD pick back up from there.

Inspiration had struck, and a couple hours later I had knocked together a prototype using
[AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) and
[SpeechRecognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) APIs.
